package interfaces;

/**
 * An object that measures the cost of an edge in the graph.
 * 
 * Similar to how in the first programming project you used the Comparitor
 * interface to compare objects of an arbitrary type, this interface turns an
 * arbitrary edge data object into a numeric "cost" that can be used in
 * calculating shortest paths and spanning trees.
 * 
 * For instance, your edge data might include lots of information (street names,
 * distances, speed limits, etc.). This interface allows you to transform that
 * object with all that information into a "cost". This cost might be the length
 * of the street, or the expected time in minutes to traverse the street. The
 * possibilities are endless!
 *
 * @param <T>
 *            The type of edge data stored in the graph.
